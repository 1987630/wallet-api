# Deep links examples for tonkeeper

**Important:** `txrequest-url` and QRCodes from examples will not work on localhost, for testing you need to run on the server with `https`. `txrequest-inline` deep links will work on localhost.

Insert data into [TxBodyData.ts](https://github.com/tonkeeper/wallet-api/blob/deeplink-examples/deeplink-examples/src/TxBodyData.ts)

And run 
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
